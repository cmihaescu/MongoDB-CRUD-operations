# CMS-with-Express-and-Mongoose

This is a simple CMS project with CRUD operations implemented. Clone the repository, run "npm install" and then "npm start' in the terminal. Go to http://localhost:3000/. It connects to a database via mongoose so any changes you make to the blog post will be remembered. There is also a dedicated section to a static blog. Hope you enjoy it!
